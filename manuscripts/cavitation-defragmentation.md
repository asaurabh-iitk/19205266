# Liquid jet breakup due to acoustic cavitation

## Results and discussions

### Jet breakup with increasing manifold pressure

1. results on the train of 'mostly periodic' structures
2. description with focus on the formation of structures in addition to those expected from kinematics of jet with velocity oscillations; corresponding radial expansion of these additional structures and breakup
	a. if helpful, comparison of results from Dunne, Cassen; and CFD simulation
	b. include differences in the formation of droplets due to jet breakup from cavitation structures and those due to jet kinematics -- via estimate of liquid sheet thickness, visual comparison of droplets formed; look at description of secondary atomization of droplets and the breakup of water bells for 'b'
4. discussion on the speed of periodic structures -- the structures are formed at separation of 1/20000 s, their separation therefore gives the speed at which they travel.

### Bubble cloud formation in the injector manifold

1. Acoustic field expected under the sonicator head
2. features of the cloud formed at varying manifold pressures

### Cavitation-induced disturbances on the liquid jet

1. the timing/spacing of the cavitation structures with respect to structures formed due to velocity fluctuations
	a. the relation to the formation of cavitation bubbles during an acoustic cycle
2. POD modes and corresponding spacing calculation for the different modes
	a. relation of the large spacing modes to bubble cloud oscillations
3. Effect of manifold pressure on the above

### Effect of forcing amplitude and manifold geometry
